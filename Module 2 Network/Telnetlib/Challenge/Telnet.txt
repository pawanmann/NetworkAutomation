Challenge #1

Create a Python script that connects to a Cisco Router using Telnet and 
executes the show users command in order to display the logged-in users.

Print out the output of the command.


Challenge #2

Change the solution from the previous challenge so that 
it will prompt the user for its password without echoing (use getpass module). 
Run the script in the terminal (you can not run it in PyCharm).



Challenge #3

Create a Python script that connects to a Cisco Router using Telnet,
enters the enable mode, and then executes the show run command. 
Save the output to a file.

Challenge #4

A Network Engineer has created this Python script that executes show ip interface brief on a remote Cisco Router using Telnet 
and displays the output.

However, instead of the normal output of the command (a string), it displays some sort of gibberish.

Your task is to troubleshoot the issue and solve it so that it displays the entire output correctly.
